# Viruses

The <topic>SARS-CoV-2</topic> <topic>virus</topic> is not the first <topic>coronavirus</topic>. In fact, quite a few are known.

We first list the SARS-CoV viruses:

<sparql>allSARSCoVViruses</sparql>

This gives us:

<out>allSARSCoVViruses</out>

But the full list of coronaviruses looks like this:

<sparql>allCoronaViruses</sparql>

Which gives us:

<out>allCoronaViruses</out>

## The seven coronaviruses that infect human

However, for the current pandemic, the seven human corona viruses may be of particular interest [<cite>Q86729469</cite>].
We can use this query to just list these:

<sparql>humanCoronaviruses</sparql>

This gives us a good starting point to study the virus in more detail:

<out>humanCoronaviruses</out>

## NCBI Taxonomy IDs

For the coronaviruses we can list the <topic>NCBI Taxonomy</topic> [<cite>Q28740981</cite>] identifiers with:

<sparql>allSARSCoVVirusesTaxonomy</sparql>

This gives us:

<out>allSARSCoVVirusesTaxonomy</out>
