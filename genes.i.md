# Genomes, Genes, and Proteins

## Genomes

Perhaps the first question should be, which <topic>genomes</topic> have been measured for the SARS-CoV-2 virus:

<sparql>genomes</sparql>

Which lists these genome URLs:

<out>genomes</out>

## Proteins

Alternatively, we may be interested in the proteins of the coronaviruses.
We can get those with this query:

<sparql>virusProteins</sparql>

Which gives us these proteins:

<out>virusProteins</out>

### PDB structures

For the proteins, we can then query for the PDB structures [<cite>Q30491855</cite>]:

<sparql>virusProteinsPDB</sparql>

Which gives us:

<out>virusProteinsPDB</out>
